<h1> PUBG </h1>
<body>
   <p> With over 20 million copies sold worldwide, and a console launch coming soon, PlayerUnknown 
    Battlegrounds-better known as “PUBG” respectively secures a spot as one of the best games out today.
    The popular battle royale game was created by a Korean based studio; Bluehole studio. The game was 
    released uncompleted early this year, PUBG has a peak of 2.5 million players online. This is an 
    incredible accomplishment because, for such a new game, it surpassed the online presence of players
    from older popular games like Dota 2 and CSGO. Even more interestingly enough, in the first 5 weeks 
    in Steam’s early access section, the developing game sold nearly 2 million copies!
    At the startup menu, you have the option to choose which mode you would prefer…show more content…
    The package can drop valuable items such as weapons, ammunition, and other equipment. The supply drop 
    also often instigates a battle between players for the possession of the loot, which can get hectic 
    at times but also very thrilling. 
    The open world game is visually and mechanically breathtaking! The game can run on a 4K resolution,
    which only makes the landscapes more detail and overall stunning. You can clearly see the amount of 
    time and effort that went into the design of the buildings. The weapons themselves look authentic and
    the sound amazing to shoot with different firing modes. PUBG offers a variety of weapons from short 
    to long-range guns, melee options, as well as bombs. Not only that, you can also add accessories to 
    your guns such as scopes, suppressors, and extended magazines. The insane amount of work put into 
    the development is insane, however, the game is not without flaw.
